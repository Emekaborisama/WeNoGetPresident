## Xenophobia Tweets


Xenophobic violence against foreign nationals in South Africa has worsened. South Africa witnessed widespread xenophobic attacks since 1994 in provinces such as Gauteng, Western Cape, Free State, Limpopo and KwaZulu Natal. There has been this and much speculation of the causes and triggers of the violence. A number of reports have highlighted various issues contributing to xenophobia; some of which include poor service delivery and competition for resources. The type of leadership within communities might have an impact on whether or not xenophobic attacks occur in certain communities, which talks to issues of governance. The issue is not only about foreign nationals and their rights, but about the safety of all who live in South Africa. Most incidents of violent attacks have been carried out by black South Africans.

The internet has become a powerful tool that people use to advocate for a cause, we thank God for social media and how much it allow us to speak without been covered up(Freedom of Speech)

This Year(2019), Xenophobia atttack become more violence than ever, my thought thou. Citizen couldn't revenge physically but were able to show their concern through the internet (Social Media and other channels) so the Govt can perform their duites.
